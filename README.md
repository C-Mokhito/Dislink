# Dislink

I'm back, yes, three years later.

Today Iâ€™d like to introduce a system I really wished I had back in 2022: a link detector.

The code is relatively simple, and you're free to use, modify, and distribute it, including in commercial projects, as long as you retain the original copyright and include the MIT license in any redistributed version.

I'm glad to be back, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
