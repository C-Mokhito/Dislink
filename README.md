# Dislink

I'm back, yes, three years later.

It’s been a while, but I’m excited to finally share something I’ve wanted to build for a long time. 

Back in 2022, I kept wishing for a simple, reliable way to detect links, whether for moderation, automation, or just basic filtering. So I built it.

Today, I’m introducing a lightweight and flexible link detection system that does exactly that.

The code is intentionally kept straightforward and clean.

You can use it as-is, right out of the box, or tweak it however you like to fit your needs.

I’ve included editable JSON files to make configuration as easy as possible — no need to dig into the code if you just want to change a few settings.

But if you’re the kind of person who likes to get under the hood, there’s plenty of room for customization.

You’re free to use, modify, and share this project, even in commercial applications, under the terms of the MIT license. Just make sure to keep the original license and copyright notice.

This is just the beginning.

I plan to keep improving the system and adding new features over time, based on feedback and future ideas.

It’s good to be back, and I hope this tool proves useful to you.

See you again soon.
