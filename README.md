# How to use it 
Dislink is designed to be easy to use! Let's take a step-by-step look:

- Place the DLL in the `Plugins` folder on your server
- Launch your server with the plugin inside
- A folder named “Dislink” will be created inside the “Plugins” folder
- The two JSON files will be inside, so you can modify them

Everything else is handled automatically!

# How to modify the code
Modifying it couldn't be easier! Download the `sln` file and open it in Visual Studio (2019 is compatible, but version 2022 is recommended).

Once open, you'll have access to the entire code and can modify it as you see fit.

Just mention the name of the author (me) and the name of the license (MIT).
